# 1. Event-Driven Architecture

**Definition:** Components communicate through events.

**Usage:** Ideal for real-time data processing, IoT systems, and financial trading platforms.

**Key Points:**
- Generates events (e.g., user actions, sensor readings).
- Manages event channels and routes events.
- Consumers take action based on specific events.
- Decouples producers and consumers for independent scaling.

# 2. Layered Architecture

**Definition:** Organizes the system into hierarchical layers.

**Usage:** Suitable for enterprise applications like e-commerce platforms and banking systems.

**Key Points:**
- Presentation Layer: Manages the user interface.
- Business/Application Layer: Contains core functionality.
- Data Access Layer: Manages database interactions.
- Persistence Layer: Handles data storage and retrieval.
- Infrastructure Layer: Provides common services like logging and security.

# 3. Monolithic Architecture

**Definition:** A single, tightly coupled application.

**Usage:** Best for small to medium-sized applications like simple web apps and internal tools.

**Key Points:**
- Single deployment unit.
- Uses a shared database.
- Includes all functionalities in one application.
- Easier initial development but harder to maintain and scale.

# 4. Microservices Architecture

**Definition:** Composed of small, independent services.

**Usage:** Ideal for large, complex applications like e-commerce sites and SaaS apps.

**Key Points:**
- API Gateway: Routes user requests to microservices.
- Individual Services: Each handles a specific function.
- Separate Databases: Decentralized data management.
- Independent Deployment: Services can be scaled independently.

# 5. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture

**Definition:** Separates an application into Model, View, and Controller.

**Usage:** Suitable for web apps like content management systems and e-commerce platforms.

**Key Points:**
- Model: Manages data and business logic.
- View: Displays information to users.
- Controller: Handles user input and updates the model and view.
- Separation of concerns for easier management and testing.

# 6. Master-Slave Architecture

**Definition:** One server (master) handles writes and updates slaves for read operations.

**Usage:** Suitable for high-availability applications like databases and data warehousing.

**Key Points:**
- Master: Manages write operations.
- Slaves: Handle read operations to balance load.
- Synchronization ensures data consistency.
- Provides redundancy and improved read performance.
