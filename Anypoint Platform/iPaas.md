## Integration platform as a service (iPaaS)

Integration platform as a service (iPaaS) provides a centralized console to manage, govern, and integrate cloud-based applications. These tools work by connecting cloud applications and services and controlling integration flows. They can speed up product development by integrating existing tools, and increase data volume by utilizing external sources. Companies use these tools to scale performance needs, add product functionality, and structure application integrations. Features or data can be added or removed quickly, reducing failover, downtime, and development time. iPaaS provides the infrastructure for creating connections and deploying software applications within the cloud.

There is some relationship between iPaaS and enterprise service bus (ESB) software, but iPaaS is typically used for customer-facing applications and is deployed on cloud, while ESB is used for internal data transfers and is deployed on premises.

To qualify for inclusion in the iPaaS category, a product must:
- Build, deploy, and manage integrations within the cloud
- Allow users to govern and manage integration flows
- Connect various cloud-to-cloud systems and solutions
- Consolidate cloud solutions into a single platform

MuleSoft, a global leader in iPaaS, commands a 38.49% market share, focusing on API integration. 
Oracle Integration Cloud holds a 4.17% share and is popular mainly among Oracle Cloud users.
Yet, Gartner selected MuleSoft as a leader nine times on their Magic Quadrant™ for Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) report.
