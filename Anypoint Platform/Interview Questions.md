1. The main difference is CloudHub is using EC2 instance in AWS for application deployment and CloudHub 2.0 is using EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) in AWS for application deployment.

2. CloudHub has maximum of 16 vCores with 32gb memory, but CloudHub 2.0 has maximum of 4 vCores 15gb memory.

3. The Minimum memory that CloudHub has is 0.1 vCores 512Mb memory, while CloudHub 2.0â€™s minimum memory is 0.1 vCores with 1.2gb memory.

4. As EKS is known to be fast, applications deployed in CloudHub 2.0 are faster than CloudHub applications.

5. In CloudHub we have the instance as workers and worker size, where in CloudHub 2.0 are named as Replicas and Replica size.

6. CloudHub we have Persistent queue option, where CloudHub 2.0 doesn't have the Persistent queue option. Instead we use MQ in CloudHub 2.0.
7. When deployed to CloudHub, application's connection is http as default, where CloudHub 2.0 has https connection by default.
