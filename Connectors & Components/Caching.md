Identifying key aspects of your data such as when to use cache and which cache strategy to follow, helps you to improve processing performance:

Is the data frequently called, with often repeated results?

Can you afford eventual consistency between the data source and the cache information? At least for a while until cache refreshes.

Mule runtime engine (Mule) offers customizable strategies, such as the Cache scope and the HTTP Caching API Gateway policy, to enable cache according to your needs. Both strategies help applications that constantly request the same data by reducing the processing load, especially network interactions with a remote host.

For Cache scope, consider a production environment in which the default in-memory caching consumes all of your memory resources. To avoid this consumption, use an object-store caching configuration with well-defined storage and expiry policies.
