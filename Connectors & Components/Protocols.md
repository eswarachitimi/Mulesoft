## What is Protocol?

A protocol is a set of rules that determines how data is sent and received over a network. The protocol is just like a language that computers use to talk to each other, ensuring they understand and can respond to each otherâ€™s messages correctly. Protocols help make sure that data moves smoothly and securely between devices on a network.

To make communication successful between devices, some rules and procedures should be agreed upon at the sending and receiving ends of the system. Such rules and procedures are called Protocols. Different types of protocols are used for different types of communication.

#### Types of Protocol:

- **_Network Layer Protocols :_** Network layer protocols operate in the network layer which is also known as the Layer 3 of the network  architecture. Network layer protocols are responsible for packet routing, forwarding, and addressing of data packets throughout the network. `IP` and `ICMP` are the network layer protocols.
- **_Transport Layer Protocols:_** Transport layer protocols work in the transport layer which provides end-to-end service ensuring data transfer across apps on different devices. TCP and UDP are the most popular transport layer protocols.
- **_Application Layer Protocol:_** Application layer protocol working in the application layer of the network architecture provides communication between applications running on different devices. The application layer protocols enable cross-device communication. They format, exchange, and interpret application data. HTTP, FTP, and SMTP are examples.
- **_Wireless Protocols:_** Wireless protocols basically used in wireless communication which enables data transfer through wireless networks. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and LTE protocols are examples.
- **_Routing Protocols:_** Routing protocol establishes the best/optimal network pathways throughout the network for fastest data transmission. Routers share information to develop and maintain routing tables. RIP, OSPF, and BGP are examples.
- **_Security Protocols :_** security protocol protects data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity while transmission of data over the network. They include SSL and TLS, encryption methods, and authentication protocols for providing data security.
- **_Internet Protocols :_** IP identifies devices uniquely. Internet protocol provides data communication through routing and  forwarding data packets from one device to another by unique addressing scheme.

#### Here are some key protocols that are widely used in computer networks:

- **_TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):_** Ensures data is sent and received accurately by breaking it into packets, sending them, and reassembling them at the destination.
- **_IP (Internet Protocol):_** Addresses and routes the packets to make sure they reach the right destination.
- **_HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol/Secure):_** HTTP used for transferring web pages on the internet. When you browse a website, your browser uses HTTP to request and display web pages. And HTTPs is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data to protect it from being intercepted.
- **_FTP (File Transfer Protocol):_** Used for transferring files between computers on a network. It allows users to upload and download files.SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Used for sending emails. It transfers emails from a client to a server or between servers.
- **_DNS (Domain Name System):_** It is used to translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.
- **_DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):_** Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network, ensuring each device has a unique address.
- **_SSH (Secure Shell):` Provides a secure way to access and manage devices over a network. It encrypts the data, making it safe from eavesdropping.
- **_SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):_** Used for managing and monitoring network devices like routers, switches, and servers. It collects and organizes information about these devices
