## What is Protocol?

A protocol is a set of rules that determines how data is sent and received over a network. The protocol is just like a language that computers use to talk to each other, ensuring they understand and can respond to each otherâ€™s messages correctly. Protocols help make sure that data moves smoothly and securely between devices on a network.

To make communication successful between devices, some rules and procedures should be agreed upon at the sending and receiving ends of the system. Such rules and procedures are called Protocols. Different types of protocols are used for different types of communication.
