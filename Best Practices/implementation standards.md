## Design & Architecture
### API-Led Connectivity

Design APIs into three layers—Experience, Process, and System—to promote reusability, scalability, and modularity across the organization. 

### Contract-First Approach

Begin by designing the API using RAML or OpenAPI to create a clear contract before implementation, which consumers can then use. 

### Modular Design

Adopt a microservices architecture and design APIs using modular components and reusable schemas. 

### Versioning

Implement semantic versioning to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility for your APIs. 

## Coding Practices

### Modularize Logic

Separate reusable logic into subflows and keep error handling in dedicated flows to improve maintainability. 

### Avoid Hardcoding
Never hardcode credentials, IP addresses, or connection details; instead, use property files and environment variables. 

### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling mechanisms, such as retry strategies, fallback mechanisms, and circuit breakers, to ensure flow resilience. 

### Input Validation

Sanitize and validate input data at the beginning of the flow to prevent issues later in the process. 

### Use Specific Connectors

Leverage MuleSoft's specialized connectors (e.g., for Salesforce or SAP) for enhanced functionality over generic ones. 

### Reuse Configurations

Centralize and reuse connector configurations to reduce redundancy. 

## Security

### Secure Sensitive Data

Use secure property placeholders or vaults to encrypt and manage passwords and other sensitive information. 

### Authentication & Authorization

Implement authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0) and role-based access controls to safeguard data. 

### Encrypt Data in Transit

Use HTTPS for secure communication to protect data as it travels across networks. 

## Testing & Quality

### Write Unit Tests

Write MUnit tests for all Mule flows and aim for high test coverage (e.g., >80%) to ensure code quality. 

### Test for Resilience

Test your error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure the integration is reliable and can handle failures gracefully. 

## Deployment & Operations

### Implement Monitoring and Alerting

Set up proactive logging and alerting systems to monitor key performance metrics (response times, errors) and identify issues early. 

### Asynchronous Logging

Use asynchronous logging for production environments to avoid impacting performance, with an appropriate minimum log level (e.g., WARN). 

# Business app complexity: 

Please consider for you application categorization below definitions. Use cases are not exclusive. 

## Simple 

- Sequential operations on single payloads with little or no routing logic
- Simple data transformation logic
- Small payloads < 100 KB
- Common use cases: API proxies, Experience APIs, System APIs with CRUD operations to single backends systems. 

## Medium: 

- Orchestration of between 3 and 5 systems/services with routing logic
- Medium-complexity transformation logic
- Small to Medium payloads < 1MB.
- Common use cases: Experience APIs, Process APIs, System APIs with CRUD operations to backends systems with transactions management and/or low-to-medium memory demanding connectors.
  
## Complex 

- Orchestration of between 5 and 10 systems/services with data enrichment and aggregation
-  Complex transformation logic or big payloads processings
- Medium to Big payloads < 10MB
- Common use cases: Process APIs, System APIs with CRUD operations to backends systems with transactions management and/or medium-high memory demanding connectors. 

## Very Complex 
- Orchestration of more than 10 systems/services with data enrichment and aggregation
- Very complex transformation logic with big payloads processing
- Very Big Payloads > 10 MB < 1 GB
- Common use cases: Process APIs, System APIs with CRUD operations to backends systems with transactions management and/or high memory demanding connectors.
