# API-Led Connectivity

_**`API-led connectivity`**_ is a modern approach to integrating applications and data using reusable APIs, replacing point-to-point integrations for a more flexible, scalable, and agile architecture. It focuses on creating well-defined APIs that can be managed, secured, published, and monetized, enabling faster and more efficient integrations.

**_Bottom-up approach:_**

APIs are created at the system layer and then reused to build higher-level APIs for processes and experiences.

## Three-layer approach:

- **System Layer:** APIs access backend systems and provide a way of insulation.
- **Process Layer:** These APIs interact with system APIs, providing aggregation, orchestration, and encapsulating business capabilities.
- **Experience Layer:** Where APIs are exposed and consumed by their intended audience.
  
_**API Management:**_ APIs are managed, secured, published, and monetized using API management software.

_**Data Transformation and Enrichment:**_ APIs can act as intermediaries, enabling data transformation, enrichment, and validation.
