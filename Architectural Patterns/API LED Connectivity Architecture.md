# API-Led Connectivity

_**`API-led connectivity`**_ is a modern approach to integrating applications and data using reusable APIs, replacing point-to-point integrations for a more flexible, scalable, and agile architecture. It focuses on creating well-defined APIs that can be managed, secured, published, and monetized, enabling faster and more efficient integrations.

**_Bottom-up approach:_**

APIs are created at the system layer and then reused to build higher-level APIs for processes and experiences.

## Three-layer approach:

- **System Layer:** `Building Blocks of Integration`

  APIs access backend systems. This layer involves creating APIs that expose the functionalities of individual systems, applications, or data sources. These APIs serve as the building blocks for integration and can be reused across various projects. An additional responsibility of System APIs is to expose the data in a common data model so that it can be reused within the enterprise.
  
- **Process Layer:** `Orchestrating Business Goals`

These APIs interact with system APIs, providing aggregation, orchestration, and encapsulating business capabilities.

- **Experience Layer:**

These APIs abstract the complexities of underlying systems and provide a user-friendly interface for consuming services. Where APIs are exposed and consumed by their intended audience. The gateway to user interaction, this layer encompasses user interfaces, web browsers, and mobile apps, focusing on presenting information and gathering input. 

_**API Management:**_ APIs are managed, secured, published, and monetized using API management software.

_**Data Transformation and Enrichment:**_ APIs can act as intermediaries, enabling data transformation, enrichment, and validation. 

> **The Pros outsmarts the cons**

### Cons

- Network calls there by incurring network latency because of multiple layers ( Creates multiple nodes of API Network ).

### Benefits:

- Moving for Legacy to Digital Enablement.
- Abstraction ( Abstracting protocols, security & transformation. All the complex overhead that has to be done to get the data. Consumer knows about the experience API. System API & Process API implementation is abstracted)
-  Innovation - Experience API is driving this. Multiple consumers can use this
