Use the Pipes and Filters architectural style to divide a larger processing task into a sequence of smaller, independent processing steps (Filters) that are connected by channels (Pipes).

# Message Router
How can you decouple individual processing steps so that messages can be passed to different filters depending on a set of conditions?

Insert a special filter, a Message Router, which consumes a Message from one Message Channel and republishes it to a different Message Channel channel depending on a set of conditions.

# Content-Based Router
How do we handle a situation where the implementation of a single logical function (e.g., inventory check) is spread across multiple physical systems?
