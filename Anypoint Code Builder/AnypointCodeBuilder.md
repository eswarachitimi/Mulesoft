DataSense is a feature of Anypoint Studio that uses Mule event metadata to help you design applications. Rather than forcing you to manually discover this metadata, Anypoint Studio automatically acquires it so that you can map or use this data in your application.

For example, if you type `#[payload.` and press `Ctrl+Spacebar`, you get a list of all the properties and methods associated with that payload.
