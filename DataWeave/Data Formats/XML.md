What is XML?

 XML `Extensible Markup Language`, is a markup language designed to store and transport data, allowing for structured and flexible data representation and exchange between systems. 

- While both XML and JSON are used for data exchange, JSON is generally considered simpler and more lightweight than XML.

Purpose:
XML is used to describe data, not to display it like HTML, and is designed for structured data storage and exchange, facilitating data sharing between different applications and systems. 
Flexibility:
XML allows you to create custom tags to define your own data structures, making it highly adaptable to various data formats and applications. 
Key Features:
Data Structure: XML uses a tree-like structure with elements, attributes, and text content to organize data. 
Human and Machine Readable: XML is designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable, allowing for easy data interpretation and processing. 
Standardized Syntax: XML has a standardized syntax, ensuring that data can be parsed and interpreted correctly across different systems and platforms. 
Uses:
XML is used in various applications, including:
Data Interchange: Sharing data between different applications, databases, and systems. 
Web Services: Facilitating communication and data exchange between web services. 
E-commerce: Storing and exchanging product information and transaction data. 
Document Formats: Storing documents and other data in a structured format (e.g., Microsoft Office formats like .docx, .xlsx, .pptx). 
Configuration Files: Storing application settings and configurations.
