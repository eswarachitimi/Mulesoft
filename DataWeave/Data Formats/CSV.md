### Features of CSV files

- CSV files are simple, text-based, and easy to create and edit.
- CSV files can be used with most spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets and databases. 
- Structured data plays a critical role in data management and information exchange, and the CSV file format is one of the simplest formats for representing structured data.
 - Many enterprise software programs rely on CSV imports for onboarding user data. At the same time, plenty of programs have CSVs as their primary output for reports.
 - We can use a CSV file to move data between programs that aren't ordinarily able to exchange data.
 - Despite the name, a CSV doesn't need to rely on commas as the separator between pieces of information. `This separator, called a delimiter, can be a semicolon, space, pipe symbol or some other character, though the comma is most common`.
 - CSV files lack a graphical interface, which can make data manipulation more challenging.
