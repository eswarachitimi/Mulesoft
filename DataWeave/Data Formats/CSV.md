### What is CSV?

CSV stands for Comma-Separated Values. It's a plain text file format that uses commas to separate values and newlines to separate records. CSV files allows data to be saved in a table structured format.

> **MIME type (or) Media Type (or) Content-Type:** application/csv

> **File Name:** <File_Name>.csv

 - Structured data plays a critical role in data management and information exchange, and the CSV file format is one of the simplest formats for representing structured data.
 - CSV files are most commonly encountered in spreadsheets and databases.
 - Many enterprise software programs rely on CSV imports for onboarding user data. At the same time, plenty of programs have CSVs as their primary output for reports.
 - We can use a CSV file to move data between programs that aren't ordinarily able to exchange data.
 - It's a way to exchange structured information. What makes a CSV file unique is the way its content is organized.
 - Despite the name, a CSV doesn't need to rely on commas as the separator between pieces of information. This separator, called a delimiter, can be a semicolon, space, pipe symbol or some other character, though the comma is most common.
