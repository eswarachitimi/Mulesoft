RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) is a widely used, human-readable language for designing RESTful APIs in MuleSoft. RAML enables developers to define API endpoints, methods, request/response payloads, and security in a structured format. This makes it easy to design, document, and manage APIs effectively.

### _What is RAML?_

RAML is a language that simplifies the process of designing APIs by providing a clear, structured format. With RAML, you can define:

- Endpoints and HTTP Methods
- Query parameters and headers
- Request and response bodies
- Data types and schemas
- Security configurations, such as OAuth

RAML is part of MuleSoft’s API-first approach, which emphasizes defining and designing APIs before implementing them. This approach ensures that APIs are consistent, reusable, and easy to manage.

### _Why Use RAML in MuleSoft?_

- **Standardized API Design:** RAML offers a consistent format that allows developers to understand and collaborate on API design.
- **Documentation:** RAML serves as both an API blueprint and documentation, making it easier for developers and stakeholders to understand API functionality.
- **Reusability:** RAML allows you to reuse data types, endpoints, and security settings across multiple APIs.
- **Compatibility with MuleSoft:** Anypoint Platform supports RAML, enabling you to import RAML files directly into Mule projects.

### _Define the API Basics_

Basic metadata for your RAML API.

```
#%RAML 1.0
title: Customer API
version: v1
baseUri: https://api.example.com/{version}
mediaType: application/json
```

- **title:** A friendly name for the API.
- **version:** The API version, which can be referenced throughout the RAML file.
- **baseUri:** The base URI of the API, using `{version}` to represent the version number dynamically.
- **mediaType:** Sets the default media type for requests and responses.

### _let’s define a GET method for fetching customer data_

```
/customers:
  get:
    description: Retrieve a list of customers
    responses:
      200:
        body:
          application/json:
            type: Customer[]
            example: |
              [
                {
                  "id": "1",
                  "name": "John Doe",
                  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
                },
                {
                  "id": "2",
                  "name": "Jane Smith",
                  "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
                }
              ]
      400:
        description: Bad request
      500:
        description: Internal server error
```

- **/customers:** This path represents the API endpoint for accessing customer data.
- **GET:** Defines the GET method to retrieve customer data.
- **responses:** Lists the expected response codes and body formats.
- **200:** Success response with an example JSON array of customers.
- **400:** Error code for bad requests.
- **500:** Error code for server errors.

**_Define a reusable Customer type to enforce consistent data structure across endpoints_**

```
types:
  Customer:
    type: object
    properties:
      id:
        type: string
        description: Unique identifier for the customer
      name:
        type: string
        required: true
        description: Full name of the customer
      email:
        type: string
        required: true
        description: Customer's email address
```

- **types:** This section defines reusable types within the RAML file.
- **Customer:** Defines an object structure for customer data, including `id`, `name`, and `email`.
- **required: true:** Specifies that `name` and `email` are required fields for a valid customer object.

### _Implement Security (Optional)_

If your API requires authentication, you can add security schemes. Here’s an example using OAuth 2.0:

```
securitySchemes:
  oauth_2_0:
    description: OAuth 2.0 Authentication
    type: OAuth 2.0
    describedBy:
      headers:
        Authorization:
          description: Access token for the API
          type: string
      responses:
        401:
          description: Unauthorized access
    settings:
      authorizationUri: https://auth.example.com/oauth/authorize
      accessTokenUri: https://auth.example.com/oauth/token
      authorizationGrants: [ authorization_code ]
```

- **securitySchemes:** Defines available security configurations for the API.
- **OAuth 2.0:** Configures OAuth 2.0 as the security method, with endpoints for obtaining authorization tokens.

### _RAML file for Customer API -_

````

Metadata: The RAML starts with metadata that defines the version of RAML, the title, version, and base URI of the API.
Types: This section defines the data structures used in the API. In this case, we’ve defined a Book type.
Resources: The /books and /books/{bookId} are resources. Each resource can have multiple HTTP methods (get, post, delete, etc.).
Query Parameters: The get method under /books accepts query parameters to filter books by author and publishedBefore.
Responses: Each HTTP method has potential responses. For example, the get method can return a 200 OK response with a list of books, and the post method can return a 201 Created response with the created book’s details.
URI Parameters: The /books/{bookId} resource uses a URI parameter {bookId} to represent a specific book ID.
